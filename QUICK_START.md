# Quick Start Guide - Fixing Admin Panel Errors

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Use placeholder values in this documentation. Never paste your real environment variable values into docs or version control.

If you're seeing "500 Internal Server Error" when trying to upload videos through the admin panel, it's likely due to missing environment variables in Netlify.

## Required Netlify Environment Variables

You need to configure these environment variables in your Netlify dashboard:

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: Site settings > Environment variables
   - Click "Add a variable"

2. **Add These Variables**

   | Variable Name | Description | Example Value |
   |---------------|-------------|---------------|
   | `OKH_PASS` | Admin passphrase (min 16 characters) | `<YOUR_STRONG_PASSPHRASE>` |
   | `BLOBS_NAMESPACE` | Netlify Blobs storage namespace | `<YOUR_BLOBS_NAMESPACE>` |
   | `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Your Cloudinary cloud name | `<YOUR_CLOUD_NAME>` |
   | `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` | Cloudinary upload preset (must be unsigned) | `<YOUR_UNSIGNED_PRESET>` |
   | `CLOUDINARY_FOLDER` | Cloudinary folder for thumbnails | `<YOUR_CLOUDINARY_FOLDER>` |

3. **Set Variable Scope**
   - Make sure to set each variable for both:
     - ✅ Production
     - ✅ Deploy previews

## Cloudinary Setup

If you haven't set up Cloudinary yet:

1. **Create Account**: [cloudinary.com/users/register/free](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free)
2. **Create Upload Preset**:
   - Go to Settings > Upload
   - Add upload preset
   - **IMPORTANT**: Set "Signing Mode" to "Unsigned"
   - Set folder name (e.g., `example-folder`)
   - Allowed formats: `jpg,png,webp`
   - Max file size: `300000` bytes

3. **Get Credentials**:
   - Dashboard shows your Cloud name
   - Note your upload preset name

## Testing the Fix

After adding environment variables:

1. Trigger a new deploy (or wait for auto-deploy)
2. Access admin panel: `https://your-site.netlify.app/ok-how-admin-7x9k2mq8p`
3. Try uploading a video
4. Check Netlify Functions logs if issues persist

> 💡 **Remember**: All values shown in this guide are placeholders. Use your actual configuration values in Netlify's environment variables dashboard, not in documentation files.

## Common Error Messages (Now Fixed)

✅ **"Server configuration error: Missing BLOBS_NAMESPACE"**
   - Solution: Add `BLOBS_NAMESPACE=<YOUR_BLOBS_NAMESPACE>` to Netlify env vars

✅ **"Server configuration error: Missing CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME"**
   - Solution: Add all three Cloudinary variables to Netlify env vars

✅ **"Authentication failed"**
   - Solution: Check your `OKH_PASS` matches what you entered

✅ **"Access forbidden. CORS issue detected"**
   - Solution: Already fixed! Localhost and Netlify domains are now allowed

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ CORS preflight handler now returns correct format
2. ✅ Added localhost support for local testing
3. ✅ Detailed error logging in all serverless functions
4. ✅ Better error messages showing exactly which env vars are missing
5. ✅ Improved client-side error handling with specific messages
6. ✅ Added @netlify/functions package for proper TypeScript types
